# Buzzfeed Clone
A buzzfeed clone I made with a few changes. The user picks their answer from a range of 10 questions and gets told what kind of icecream flavour they are and are then redirected to play a game based on their icecream flavour.

### What I learnt

I learnt how to move through sections of the questions once the user pickes an answer with "location.href" in javascript and I also learnt how to incorporate online images in javascript.
